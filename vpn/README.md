# A simple single-user [SoftEther VPN][1] server Docker image #

## Setup ##
 - L2TP/IPSec PSK + OpenVPN (Beta)
 - SecureNAT enabled
 - Perfect Forward Secrecy (DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA)
 - make'd from [the official SoftEther VPN GitHub repo][2] master (Note: they don't have any other branches or tags.)

`docker run -d -p 500:500/udp -p 4500:4500/udp -p 1701:1701/tcp ianblenke/softethervpn`

Connectivity tested on Android + iOS devices. It seems Android devices do not require L2TP server to have port 1701/tcp open.

## Credentials ##

All optional:

- `-e PSK`: Pre-Shared Key (PSK), if not set: "notasecret" (without quotes) by default.
- `-e USERNAME`: if not set a random username ("user[nnnn]") is created.
- `-e PASSWORD`: if not set a random weak password is created.

It only creates a single user account with the above credentials in DEFAULT hub.
See the docker log for username and password (unless `-e PASSWORD` is set), which *would look like*:

    ========================
    user6301
    2329.2890.3101.2451.9875
    ========================
Dots (.) are part of the password. Password will not be logged if specified via `-e PASSWORD`; use `docker inspect` in case you need to see it.

Hub & server are locked down; they are given stronger random passwords which are not logged or displayed.

## Using docker-compose ##

There is a docker-compose.yml and a .env file in this github repo that are an example of docker-compose orchestration to spin up a pre-configured container.

To spawn a background docker container:

    docker-compose run -d

You will want to change the .env file's environment variables to contain secrets that are a bit more secure than the defaults presented here.

## Android VPN Client Configuration ##

Go into Settings -> Wireless and Networks (More...) -> VPN -> "+"

In the "Edit VPN profile" panel, enter:

    Name: Whatever label you would like
    Type: L2TP/IPSEC PSK  (Do not try to use IPSsec Xauth PSK)
    Server Address: $PUBLIC_IP_OF_YOUR_DOCKER_HOST
    l2tp secret: <not used>
    ipsec identifier: <not used>
    ipsec pre-shared key: $PSK
    login: $USERNAME
    password: $PASSWORD

## iOS VPN Client Configuration ##

Go into Settings -> VPN -> Add VPN Configuration

In the "Add Configuration" panel, enter:

    Type: L2TP
    Description: Whatever label you would like
    Server: $PUBLIC_IP_OF_YOUR_DOCKER_HOST
    Account: $USERNAME
    RSA SecurID: OFF
    Password: $PASSWORD
    Secret: $PSK
    Send All Traffic: ON

## Mac VPN Client Configuration ##

Go into System Preferences -> Network
At the bottom of the list on the left, there is a + at the bottom. Click on that.

A box will pop up, enter this:

    Interface: VPN
    VPN Type: L2TP over IPSEC
    Service Name: Whatever you like, but I suggest the server name

Click Create

This will go back to the Edit panel for the new VPN service name you just created.

    Configuration: Default
    Server Address: $PUBLIC_IP_OF_YOUR_DOCKER_HOST
    Account Name: $USERNAME

Click on the Authentication Settingsâ€¦ button

    Password: $PASSWORD
    Shared Secret: $PSK

Leave `Group Name:` empty.
Click OK

Click Advanced

Make sure "Send all traffic over VPN conneciton" is checked

Click OK

Click Apply to make this configuration take effect.

You can now click Connect to establish the VPN connection.

## OpenVPN ##

It is also possible to use openvpn instead of IPSec/L2TP:

`docker run -d -p 1194:1194/udp ianblenke/softethervpn`

The entire log can be saved and used as an `.ovpn` config file (change as needed).

**Current limitation**: Server CA certificate will be created automatically at runtime but there is no way to retrieve its private key. For now you can create _a self-signed 1024-bit RSA certificate/key pair_ locally and feed both entire contents via `-e CERT` and `-e KEY`. X.509 markers (like `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`) and any non-BASE64 character (incl. newline) can be omitted and will be ignored.

Examples (assuming bash; note the double-quotes `"` and backticks `` ` ``):

* ``-e CERT="`cat server.crt`" -e KEY="`cat server.key`"``
* `-e CERT="MIIDp..b9xA=" -e KEY="MIIEv..x/A=="`
* `--env-file <cert-and-key.list>`

Certificate volumes support (like `-v` or `--volumes-from`) will be added at some point...
